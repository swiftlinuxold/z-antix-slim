The critical file is /etc/slim.conf .  The available options under sessions in this file are the ones that show up when you press the F1 key in SLiM.

Changing this file is enough when running the desktop script or running the live CD.  (The /etc/slim.conf file is preserved in the live CD.)

However, when you install Swift Linux, the /etc/slim.conf file is overwritten, and the changes are gone.

Additional files to change:
/etc/skel/.xinitrc
/etc/init.d/antiX-init.sh (line 724 and below)

/usr/share/antiX/localisation/en/local-bin/user-management
